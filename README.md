I'm a firmware developer from St. John's, Newfoundland, with an interest in Newfoundland and Labrador provincial and Canadian federal politics.

I plan to use this site to publish small political data analysis/visualization projects, starting with my [Federal Elections Visualizer](https://www.shanewilliams.ca/elections). Over time, I hope to add more interactive data analysis projects and blog posts.
